# Design of a low voltage, high gain MOS operational amplifier in sub-threshold region
- Simulated on LTSpice using TSMC 180nm technology.
- Systematically derived transistor parameters based on a set of constraints including gain, UGB, Phase margin and Power Dissipation.
- All the transistors operate in the subthreshold region with Vdd set to 2.5V.
- Project done as a part of the course EEE F313 Analog and Digital VLSI Design.
